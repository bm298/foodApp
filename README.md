# Recipe Generator App

## Overview

My Recipe Generator App named ChefAI is a web application that helps users find recipes based on their preferences and available ingredients. Whether you're feeling a specific mood, craving a particular cuisine, or simply need to make use of ingredients you have at home, this app provides personalized recipe suggestions to suit your needs. 

The app allows users to:

- **Add ingredients they have at home** and **exclude ingredients they can't consume** (e.g., allergies or dislikes).
- **Browse recipe suggestions** with detailed instructions, ingredient lists, and estimated preparation times.
- **Use customizable filters** to fine-tune recipe results, such as mood, time to cook, skill level, and dietary requirements.
- **Drag-and-drop interface** to manage allergies and available ingredients.
